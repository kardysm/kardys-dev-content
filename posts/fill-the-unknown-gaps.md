* Why?
* What's the thing you cannot learn?
* How to overcome it?

## There are *unknown unknowns*; how to deal with these?

Let's start in comfort zone:

We roam around *known knowns* - the space we are comfortable in. You ALREADY learned and use this.

Even in a dev job, we often face challenges we know how to solve - just a matter of time

## *Known unknowns* - skills you haven't learned YET. 

But you know what has to be learned.

Don't you know how to fix a car?
Google some tutorials.

After that, these skills move to _known knowns_

Let's keep going - *unknown knowns*

## *Unknown knowns* are accidental knowledge

For instance, blogging more often makes you think clearer. You don't realize that until you think about your pre-blogging time. Suddenly, this change is obvious.

This part is most often a byproduct of your activities ;)

Finally:
## *Unknown unknows* - this is the part you cannot learn

Why?

**You have no idea it exists.** It might be niche, but helpful skill.

Example: once, I didn't know staring at screens at night wrecks sleep.

Until I read some articles, my sleep quality was poor

What helps here?


To learn something you don't know it exists, move it to *known unknowns* part. How?

1. Take broader area you want to deep dive into
2. Search for these in a medium you prefer:


Examples of activities to learn from:

* research
* books
* articles (x ways for...)/listings
* experts in given area
* exchanging experiences with others
* infographics
* online courses
* checklists

In general:
**the more you expose your mind to others, the more ideas you get.**

Lone wolf working in his own closed basement is a myth here. This type has more unknowns than those who collaborate and talk with each other.

Why don't you go out of building and learn?
