## How to save +5$ on renewing.com domain?

Lately, I've found Cloudflare offers Registrar service without markup fees (=cheaper)

If you own domains, you can save by transferring to Cloudflare (not only .com)

## How?

It's especially helpful for those who own many domains

1. You must own a domain for more than 60 days
2. It must be valid for more than 15 days
3. Follow instructions from [Cloudflare docs](https://r.kardys.dev/cloudflare-domain-transfer)
4. Enjoy your savings ;)

### Did I test it?
Not yet.

Besides .com, multiple other TLDs are possible to move.

Unfortunately, I own TLDs which are not supported, yet.

You can check out registrar [here](https://r.kardys.dev/7jSjg)


### Where did I get +5$ saving from?

It's by comparison vs Namecheap (which I'm using for a looong time already - nice service, btw)

~8$ vs ~13,5$

I realize 5$ is not much, but this seems to be extra useful for those owning multitude of domains ;)
