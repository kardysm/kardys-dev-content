How to easily deploy your frontend project?

<!--more-->

## An opportunity. To learn and earn.

* For couple years already, availability to deploy frontend project grows.
* For couple years already, you can start completely free with just couple clicks.
* For couple years already, learning can be instantly skyrocketed with services I write here about.

At the time of writing, the latest player in this field is Cloudflare with its Pages.

## It's killer feature?

Unlimited bandwidth.

Can you imagine?

1. You deploy your app using top-notch infrastructure.
2. It is fast, free and easy.
3. You can bring just one person or whole country to your app. Still, you pay **nothing**

In fact, it's easier to host own project than ever. Trend is growing and will, most likely, will stay growing.

You can either use it (or similar) for self-development, learning or make it commercial project - help others fulfill their needs.

Personally, I use Vercel's hosting most often.

Why?

* they're intuitive,
* they are in my field (creators of next.js)
* Vercel (formerly Zeit) is probable first of the kind I've learned about. Yeah, that count's too. If something fulfills my needs - why change it?

This blog is hosted on Vercel's cloud (it's AWS underneath). It's powered by Hugo but Vercel's capabilities are bigger. They allow 'serverless' functions, too.

## Can I use these commercially?

Of course. This is one of such system's goals. To help you. If you are trying out - for free.

Why is it free?

When you grow beyond 'hobbyist' limits - it'd be convenient for you to pay for such hosting. Free is for tryout and growing bonds between you and hosting provider.

## What are players in the field?

* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

To name a few. In fact this post is inspired by [Devesh](https://twitter.com/Deveshb15/status/1384140521283543048)

There you find bigger list. This post is rather about possibilities.

## What do I need to host such project?

Git repo is a must. Most supported (and most known)  is GitHub. It depends on given provider, but it can be made with Bitbucket or Gitlab, too.

Select provider based on which provider meets your needs.

After you have your repo somewhere, you can set up new project. If you want to attach own domain to it - here's an option, too.

If you haven't ever attached own domain, it will be rather quick and smooth process.

To sum up, you need:

* git repository hosted on github-like service (it is a must)
* domain (it is optional, but recommended for projects meant to serve others)

You learn the best by practice. So go and host something.

What next?

I have hard time going back to regular server-like environment taking that it's so easy to deploy apps the way above.
