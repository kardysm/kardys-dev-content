What do you do when you find out a stunning website. A place you are curious about. What is it built with? - you may ask. 

Here's the answer - how to check tech a site is running on.
<!--more-->

As developer I'm curious what tech is given site built with. Which programming language, server or libraries are drivers.

Here are 3 examples how to check it. 2 of these are browser extensions while 1 is a website.  
### 1. Wappalyzer
This is most commonly way to check out tech. It's simple extension that shows many aspects of given site. From UI lib, analytics to things like CDN. Extension is free.

Where to get it: https://www.wappalyzer.com/

### 2. What runs
Next browser extension, which I use in parallel to Wappalyzer. Sometimes Wappalyzer and What runs provide complementary results. While former most often provides more detailed results, latter one is useful enough to keep both installed.

It seems a little bit abandoned tho. 

Where to get it: https://www.whatruns.com/ 

### 3. Stackshare

3rd option is not another extension but a standalone website. It may provide more accurate results, because stacks are added by the company itself.

Website requires registration to check out stack of given company.  

Where is it: https://stackshare.io/ 

What are your favourite tools to check out tech running in company?
